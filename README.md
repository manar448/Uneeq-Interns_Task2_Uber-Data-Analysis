# Uneeq-Interns_Task2_Uber Data Analysis
This project explores Uber trip data using Excel to uncover patterns, trends, and actionable insights. By leveraging Excel's powerful data analysis tools, we visualize ride trends, identify peak demand times, and map popular pickup and drop-off points.

# Project Overview
The goal of this project is to perform data-driven analysis of Uber trips to: • Understand temporal trends in ride activity • Identify popular pickup and drop-off locations • Visualize demand variations by time of day and day of the week • Provide insights for operational and strategic decision-making

# Data Sources
The dataset includes Uber trip records containing: • Pickup and drop-off times • Geographic coordinates for pickup and drop-off locations • Trip distances and durations

# Objectives
• Visualize and interpret key trends in Uber trip data • Identify operational insights for optimizing ride distribution • Map high-demand locations to improve service coverage

# Tools and Techniques
• Excel Functions: Sorting, filtering, conditional formatting • Pivot Tables: Summarizing and analyzing data trends • Charts and Graphs: Visualizing time-based trends and geographic distributions • Data Cleaning: Removing duplicates, handling missing values • Geospatial Analysis: Mapping data using Excel’s mapping tools

# Analysis Highlights
• Time-Based Analysis: o Ride distribution across hours, days, and months o Identification of peak demand times • Location Analysis: o Mapping popular pickup and drop-off areas o Understanding spatial distribution of trips • Demand Forecasting: o Visualizing weekly patterns to predict future trends
