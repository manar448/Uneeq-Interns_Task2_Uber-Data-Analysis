# 📊 Uneeq-Interns_Task2_Uber Data Analysis

This project explores Uber trip data using Excel to uncover patterns, trends, and actionable insights. By leveraging Excel's powerful data analysis tools, we visualize ride trends, identify peak demand times, and map popular pickup and drop-off points.

## 📋 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to perform data-driven analysis of Uber trips to:
- **Understand** temporal trends in ride activity
- **Identify** popular pickup and drop-off locations
- **Visualize** demand variations by time of day and day of the week
- **Provide** insights for operational and strategic decision-making

## 📈 Data Sources

The dataset includes Uber trip records containing:
- Pickup and drop-off times
- Geographic coordinates for pickup and drop-off locations
- Trip distances and durations
